# MEAN Stack

## MEAN Stack

The MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. MEAN includes MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js.

### Components:
- **MongoDB**: A document-based, NoSQL database used to store application data.
- **Express.js**: A back-end web application framework for Node.js.
- **Angular**: A front-end web application framework developed by Google.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

### Benefits:
- Uniform language across the stack, improving developer productivity.
- Comprehensive set of tools and frameworks for front-end and back-end development.
- Robust support for MVC architecture and RESTful API design.
