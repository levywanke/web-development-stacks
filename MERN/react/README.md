# React

## Overview
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

## Features
- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Use Cases
React is used for developing dynamic and responsive web interfaces, single-page applications (SPAs), and mobile applications using React Native.
