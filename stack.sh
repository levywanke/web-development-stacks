  ["MERN Stack"]="## MERN Stack\n\nThe MERN stack is a JavaScript stack that's designed to make the development process smoother and easier. MERN includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.\n\n### Components:\n- **MongoDB**: A document-based, NoSQL database used to store application data.\n- **Express.js**: A back-end web application framework for Node.js.\n- **React**: A front-end library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook.\n- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.\n\n### Benefits:\n- Full JavaScript stack, allowing for a seamless development experience.\n- Strong community support and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.\n- Scalable and flexible for building modern web applications."
  ["MEAN Stack"]="## MEAN Stack\n\nThe MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. MEAN includes MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js.\n\n### Components:\n- **MongoDB**: A document-based, NoSQL database used to store application data.\n- **Express.js**: A back-end web application framework for Node.js.\n- **Angular**: A front-end web application framework developed by Google.\n- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.\n\n### Benefits:\n- Uniform language across the stack, improving developer productivity.\n- Comprehensive set of tools and frameworks for front-end and back-end development.\n- Robust support for MVC architecture and RESTful API design."
  ["MEVN Stack"]="## MEVN Stack\n\nThe MEVN stack is a variation of the MEAN stack where Angular is replaced with Vue.js. MEVN includes MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js.\n\n### Components:\n- **MongoDB**: A document-based, NoSQL database used to store application data.\n- **Express.js**: A back-end web application framework for Node.js.\n- **Vue.js**: A progressive front-end framework for building user interfaces.\n- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.\n\n### Benefits:\n- Flexible and approachable front-end development with Vue.js.\n- Full JavaScript stack, enabling streamlined development workflows.\n- Strong community support and an extensive library ecosystem."
  ["Serverless Stack"]="## Serverless Stack\n\nThe Serverless stack allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage the server infrastructure. Examples include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.\n\n### Components:\n- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services.\n- **Azure Functions**: A serverless computing service provided by Microsoft Azure.\n- **Google Cloud Functions**: A serverless computing service provided by Google Cloud Platform.\n\n### Benefits:\n- No need to manage servers, reducing operational complexity.\n- Automatic scaling to handle varying loads.\n- Pay-per-use pricing model, which can lead to cost savings."
  ["LAMP Stack"]="## LAMP Stack\n\nThe LAMP stack is a popular open-source web development platform that uses Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.\n\n### Components:\n- **Linux**: An open-source operating system.\n- **Apache**: A widely-used web server software.\n- **MySQL**: A relational database management system.\n- **PHP**: A server-side scripting language designed for web development.\n\n### Benefits:\n- Proven and stable platform with a long history of use.\n- Large community and extensive documentation.\n- Flexibility to run a wide range of web applications and services."
  ["PERN Stack"]="## PERN Stack\n\nThe PERN stack is a full-stack web development solution that uses PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js.\n\n### Components:\n- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.\n- **Express.js**: A back-end web application framework for Node.js.\n- **React**: A front-end library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook.\n- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.\n\n### Benefits:\n- Robust and scalable database solution with PostgreSQL.\n- Full JavaScript stack for a seamless development experience.\n- Rich ecosystem of tools and libraries for both front-end and back-end development."
  ["Ruby on Rails Stack"]="## Ruby on Rails Stack\n\nThe Ruby on Rails stack is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. It is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework.\n\n### Components:\n- **Ruby**: A dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.\n- **Rails**: A server-side web application framework written in Ruby.\n\n### Benefits:\n- Convention over configuration, leading to faster development.\n- Built-in tools and libraries for common web development tasks.\n- Strong emphasis on testing and best practices."
